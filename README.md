# BCM_substancePainter_shortcuts
Some custom shortcuts in Substance Painter 2018.

These are some Autohotkey scripts that are searching custom pixels on your screen and automaticaly moves and clicks your mouse in order to do some tasks faster

Features in the scripts:

1. **Toggle pressure for flow ** - when pressing Ctrl+Alt+A the mouse will go to the drop down of the Flow's pen pressure and change it 

2. **Toggle pressure for size ** - when pressing Ctrl+Alt+S the mouse will go to the drop down of the Size's pen pressure and change it 

3.**Increment sliders ** - by pressing the UP or Down Arrows when you have a text field selected it will decrease or increase the number. Ypu can change the precision by pressing the LEFT Arrow and change the options on the window

4.**Change blending options  ** - for the selected stack or layer. When pressing Alt+` a window will open when you can select one of the buttons. With this window active you can press for example 1 and the blending mode will be changed to PassThrough.


5.**Some mask options ** - pressing the ` will open a window with shortcuts you can change masks, create filters.... 

6.** Predefined shelf searches ** - pressing two times `, will open the window with predefined shelf searches. This way you can select some brushes, or open the project textures. Right now you can customize the windows by changing the .json files. Didn't had the time to make an ui for creating the buttons shortcuts, maybe in the future....if people are intrested in this...
